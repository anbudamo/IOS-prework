App Brainstorming-
PART A:
1. eBird (a birdwatching app)
   - The explore page of the app has a map view where you can search for new/active birding hotspots in your area. I love
     this feature because the map shows you all the hotspots that have been visited recently. If you are willing to drive
     longer distances you can increase the spotlight radius and the map view will highlight more locations for you. You
     can also vary the duration to show the hotspots that have been visited recently or in the last month/year. You can also
     search for target species you would like to see and the map view will highlight hotspots in the area where that species
     has been spotted
   - The color theme of the app is very light on the eyes, inviting, and refreshing. Submitted checlists (which are recorded
     while birdwatching) are highlighted in blue. Checklists which haven't been submitted are highlighted in a sienna color.
     The rest of the elements- like icons, buttons, and options- are highlighted in green. The background color of each activity
     page is white which gives a clean and minimalistic design to the app
   - There is a 'record track' switch element in the main page of the app which you can toggle on and off. I love this feature
     and element. If the switch is toggled to the 'on' state the app tracks your live location as you birdwatch and shows your
     travelling track and distance. After a birding session the app will show you a satellite-view map with the exact path you
     took while birdwatching. In case you prefer to disable this feature for particular reasons you can by toggling the switch
     to the 'off' state
   - Finally there is a page where you can view the checklist you have recorded in a list view. From my experience using the
     app I find that the sort feature is very organized and thorough. You can sort by time (month, year), by location, and
     by newest/oldest. There are enough ways to sort that it feels thorough and there isn't too many that it seems excessive.
     This feature is very convenient for me and makes the app enjoyable to use.
2. Shazam (App that identifies music by listening)
   - The splash screen is attention grabbing. When you open the app the logo shows up as the splash screen and merges into the
     activity environment. On opening the app it feels dynamic and fun. The button at the center of the screen seems to be
     breathing as it is expanding and contracting slowly. The text above the button also changes every few seconds with a swiping
     animation. I think this design fits the very essence of the app. It highlights trending music and earworms that you can't
     get out of your head. The app helps you identify the sounds that are stuck in your head. Therefore I like the fact that
     Shazam chose to design their app in a fun and attention grabbing manner.
   - I love the simple design of the app. The idea of the app itself is simple and to the point, so I like the fact that Shazam
     made their app simple and to the point as well. Normally a tab-bar controller would make an app look sectioned and organized.
     Shazam, however, does not use a tab-bar controller. In my opinion this decision plays to their strength. It brings the focus
     towards the main function of the app which is to identify songs by listening to audio. Once you have identified a song using
     the app you can now access it by swiping up the page from the bottom.
   - Another feature I love about the app is that it lets you connect to music listening apps like spotify to improve your
     user experience. There is a button in settings with the spotify logo that you can toggle on. Once you press it you can
     connect it to your spotify account and have a seamless listening experience. Shazam will recommend you music based on your
     taste. Previously Shazam didn't have this feature, and I found that I enjoyed the app much more after they introduced it.
3. Prime Video (streaming platform)
   - When I can't seem to find anything I want to watch in the moment, I can swipe down on the page to refresh the recommendations
     that are shown to me. I can then scroll through my updated recommendations which may have movies/shows that have been
     newly released on the platform
   - I like the "add to watchlist" feature of the app. It allows me to save a movie for later when I'm not in the mood to
     watch it at the moment
   - Downloading for offline viewing.
4. Youtube
   - In the Recommended page there is a floating invisible bar with buttons called "explore" where you can select recommended
     categories. These categories are tailored to your interests using AI. For me the categories are usually something like:
     "comedy", "podcasts", "skateboarding", "gyms". Previously these categories where shown in a seperate page called the
     "explore page". I never found the page useful and would never navigate to it. I have found this change incredibly
     useful as I find myself often switching between categories on the Home page and using this feature.
   - I love the in-app incognito mode which the app allows you to switch to. I love that I can allow other people to use my
     account to watch youtube without it affecting the videos youtube recommends me. I also like the apps night theme when you
     switch to incognito mode
   - When I am scrolling through videos on the main page I sometimes wish to get a preview before commiting to it and pressing it.
     I would like to know whether the thumbnail and title of the video match my expectations. Youtube allows you to watch the video
     in a mini player view simply by hovering over it. It is an extremely convenient feature that I find applicable and useful when
     regularly uing the app. Nowadays videos have grabbing titles and thumbnails, so I like that I can get a preview of the video to
     see if I'm interested before clicking it

  Part B
  Idea: A stocks app that can help me in investing by solving specific problems I've encountered over the past 6 months
  
  Explanation: I've been trying to get into stocks for the past year. This has been difficult for many reasons. Firstly, there is a barrage of
  information online on how to trade stocks. Then there is also the daily cycle of news on specific stocks that can seem overwhelming.
  In addition to this I have encountered specific problems while using stock brokerage platforms that I think an app could solve for 
  me.
  Some problems I have faced:
  1. The platform I am using does not show the history of purchase on a particular stock. That means I cannot ascertain the price I
     bought a particular stock at in the past. This information is very useful for the investor. Without it the investor cannot
     notice whether a particular stock is hurting or improving returns.
  2. There isn't a platform where I can exclusively see news about the companies I'm investing in. Decision making of a company,
     their earning reports, and negative publicity can have a large effect on its share price. It also tells the investor whether
     they would like to hold a stake in the company or not. Therefore, it is important to have news and information about the
     company you are investing in at your fingertips

  My app will be quite simple. It will show the list of stocks you are holding and the past stocks you have invested in. Over the years investors may invest 
  in tens of stocks and may not be able to keep track of attractive stock options after selling them. This app will show the stocks 
  have invested in in the past along with the hostory of its purchase. Therefore, investors can buy back into the stock when their
  outlook changes and they are interested. Similarly, the app will show the history of purchase of a stock you are currently holding.

  The organization of the app will be as follows:
  - Users can swipe between two pages, a page with current stocks in portfolio and a page with past stocks
  - The stocks symbol, name, and price will be shown. You can click it to enter an expanded view where you can view your history of
  - purchase and other details

  Another feature will be a news section where you can choose which stocks to receive news about. This will help investors get in 
  touch with the companies they are investing and stay up to date with the important happenings.
